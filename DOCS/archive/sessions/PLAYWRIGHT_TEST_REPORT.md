# Playwright Test Report - Database/Frontend Gap Analysis

## Test Execution Summary
- **Date**: 2025-08-22
- **Environment**: localhost:3000
- **Test Suite**: Full Application Health Check + Investor Portal Tests

## Overall Results
- **Total Tests Run**: 29
- **Passed**: 24 (83%)
- **Failed**: 5 (17%)

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Supabase Service Client Configuration
**Status**: FIXED
- Updated server-client.ts with proper configuration
- Added auth and schema settings for cross-schema access
- Service role key now properly configured

### 2. ✅ Cross-Schema Query Issues
**Status**: FIXED
- Updated investors.repo.ts to use proper schema syntax
- Fixed queries for:
  - `analytics.mv_investment_snapshots` → `.schema('analytics').from('mv_investment_snapshots')`
  - `deals.deal` → `.schema('deals').from('deal')`
  - `companies.company` → `.schema('companies').from('company')`
  - `public.transactions` → `.from('transactions')`

### 3. ✅ Investor Profile Page
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED & WORKING
- Full profile page with tabs for:
  - Personal Information
  - Investor Profile
  - KYC & Compliance
  - Banking Details
  - Preferences
- Successfully fetches data from `/api/investors/[id]`

## Remaining Issues

### 1. ⚠️ Formula Tables Permission Error
**Issue**: `permission denied for table deal_formula_templates`
**Location**: `/admin/formulas` and `/admin/formula-manager`
**Root Cause**: RLS policies not configured for service role
**Fix Required**: 
- Enable RLS bypass for service role in Supabase dashboard
- OR disable RLS for formula tables
- OR create proper policies for service role

### 2. ⚠️ Invalid API Key Errors (Intermittent)
**Issue**: Some endpoints returning "Invalid API key" errors
**Affected Areas**:
- Investor units fetching
- Some admin endpoints
**Root Cause**: Mixed usage of anon key vs service role key
**Fix Required**:
- Ensure all server-side APIs use service role key consistently
- Check if keys have been rotated in Supabase

### 3. ⚠️ Homepage Content Mismatch
**Issue**: Tests expecting "Equitie Platform" text not found
**Location**: Homepage (/)
**Root Cause**: Homepage content has been updated with new motion-driven design
**Fix Required**:
- Update test expectations to match new homepage content
- Tests should look for actual content like "Private Markets" instead

## Performance Observations

### Positive
- Dashboard API: ~50-100ms response time
- Portfolio API: ~60-120ms response time
- Transactions API: ~40-80ms response time
- Most pages load within 500ms

### Areas for Improvement
- Node.js 18 deprecation warnings (should upgrade to Node 20+)
- Some API calls taking >100ms (consider caching)
- Formula endpoints failing due to permissions

## Test Coverage by Area

### ✅ Working Well
1. **Investor Portal**
   - Dashboard: Full functionality with real data
   - Portfolio: Cross-schema queries working
   - Transactions: Filtering and pagination working
   - Documents: Listing and viewing working
   - Profile: Complete implementation with all tabs

2. **Admin Portal**
   - Dashboard: Basic functionality
   - Deals: CRUD operations
   - Companies: Management interface
   - Chat: AI integration working

### ❌ Need Attention
1. **Formula Management**
   - Permission errors preventing access
   - Need RLS configuration update

2. **Homepage Tests**
   - Need update to match new content structure

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Formula Permissions in Supabase**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL editor
   ALTER TABLE deal_formula_templates ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   CREATE POLICY "Service role bypass" ON deal_formula_templates
   FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt()->>'role' = 'service_role');
   ```

2. **Update Test Expectations**
   - Update homepage tests to match new motion-driven design
   - Look for "Private Markets" instead of "Equitie Platform"

3. **Verify API Keys**
   - Check Supabase dashboard for key rotation
   - Ensure .env.local has latest keys

### Medium Priority
1. **Upgrade Node.js to v20+**
   - Eliminates deprecation warnings
   - Better performance

2. **Add Response Caching**
   - Implement Redis or in-memory caching
   - Reduce database load

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Add better fallbacks for missing data
   - Improve error messages for users

## Database/Frontend Alignment Status

### ✅ Fully Aligned
- Investor dashboard data flow
- Portfolio calculations and aggregations
- Transaction history and filtering
- Profile data mapping
- Company and deal relationships

### ⚠️ Partially Aligned
- Formula management (permission issues)
- Some admin features (inconsistent key usage)

### Summary
The application is **83% functional** with most critical investor-facing features working correctly. The main gaps are in admin formula management due to RLS permissions. With the recommended fixes, the application should achieve 95%+ functionality.

## Next Steps
1. Apply RLS fixes in Supabase
2. Update failing tests
3. Run full test suite again
4. Deploy to staging for user acceptance testing
