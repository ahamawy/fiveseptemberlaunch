================================================
This seeding script is no longer needed.

The system now uses formula templates:
- standard, impossible, reddit, openai, figure
- scout, spacex1, spacex2, newheights, egypt

Each deal references a template in the 
formula_template field of deals_clean table.

Templates define how Net Capital is calculated
and which fees apply.
