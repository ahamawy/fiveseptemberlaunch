# Session Summary - 2025-08-27

## üéØ Session Objectives Completed

### 1. ‚úÖ **Established Supabase as Single Source of Truth**
- Updated all documentation to emphasize Supabase primacy
- Modified `lib/db/client.ts` to enforce Supabase in production
- Added error throwing if Supabase not configured
- Created comprehensive documentation in CLAUDE.md

### 2. ‚úÖ **Upgraded Feature Tree to v2.0.0**
- Created `FEATURES/FEATURE_TREE_V2.md` with MCP integration
- Established domain-based numbering system (0-5)
- Added `FEATURES/ROADMAP_ALIGNMENT.md` for Q1-Q2 2025
- Created `FEATURES/VERSION_CONTROL.md` for semantic versioning
- Generated comprehensive `FEATURES/README.md` documentation

### 3. ‚úÖ **Analyzed EQUITIELOGIC Directory**
- Reviewed all formula documentation and gaps
- Identified critical missing schema elements
- Created `EQUITIELOGIC/SYNC_TO_SUPABASE.sql` master sync script
- Documented all formula templates and calculation methods

### 4. ‚úÖ **Created Next Session Priority Plan**
- Generated `NEXT_SESSION_PRIORITY.md` with clear checklist
- Focused on Formula Calculation Engine as top priority
- Provided success metrics and validation queries

---

## üìä Key Statistics

- **Files Created**: 7 new documentation files
- **Lines Added**: 2,500+ lines of documentation and SQL
- **Commits**: 2 major commits with comprehensive messages
- **Feature Version**: Upgraded to v2.0.0-stable

---

## üîç Critical Findings

### Database Schema Gaps:
1. Missing `formula_calculation_log` table for audit trail
2. Missing enum types: `nc_calculation_method`, `premium_calculation_method`
3. Missing discount columns in `transactions_clean`
4. Missing MOIC/IRR tracking columns

### Formula Complexity:
- **6 different NC calculation methods** identified
- **9 unique formula templates** for different deals
- **Tiered management fees** for OpenAI and SpaceX deals
- **Fee base variations** (GC vs NC) affecting calculations

---

## üöÄ Next Session Priority

**CRITICAL: Implement Formula Calculation Engine**

The next session MUST focus on:
1. Running the `SYNC_TO_SUPABASE.sql` migration
2. Implementing all formula calculation functions
3. Validating historical calculations
4. Creating complete audit trail

This is critical because:
- **Revenue depends on accurate fee calculations**
- **Investor trust requires calculation transparency**
- **Audit compliance needs calculation logs**

## üìÅ Key Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `/FEATURES/FEATURE_TREE_V2.md` - Complete system architecture
- `/FEATURES/ROADMAP_ALIGNMENT.md` - Q1-Q2 2025 roadmap
- `/FEATURES/VERSION_CONTROL.md` - Version management system
- `/FEATURES/README.md` - Feature documentation hub
- `/EQUITIELOGIC/SYNC_TO_SUPABASE.sql` - Master sync script
- `/NEXT_SESSION_PRIORITY.md` - Next session plan
- `/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-08-27.md` - This summary

### Modified Files:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Emphasized Supabase as source of truth
- `README.md` - Added Supabase primacy warning
- `lib/db/client.ts` - Enforces Supabase in production
- `lib/services/base.service.ts` - Added Supabase comments

---

## üéØ Achievements

1. **Supabase Authority**: Now impossible to use mock data in production
2. **Documentation Clarity**: Clear feature tree and roadmap
3. **Formula Understanding**: Complete mapping of all deal formulas
4. **Migration Ready**: SQL script ready to sync all gaps

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks Identified

1. **Formula Calculation Discrepancies**: Need validation before go-live
2. **Historical Data**: May need recalculation after migration
3. **Performance**: Complex formulas may need optimization
4. **Testing**: Each formula template needs individual testing

---

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Run migration in staging first** before production
2. **Create rollback script** before executing changes
3. **Log all calculations verbosely** during initial implementation
4. **Compare old vs new calculations** for validation
5. **Consider phased rollout** by deal type

---

## üìà System Health

- **Docker Services**: All MCP services running (2+ days uptime)
- **Supabase**: Connected and operational
- **Development Server**: Running on port 3001
- **Database Records**: 683 total records tracked
- **Portfolio Value**: $20.9M managed

---

## üîó Dependencies for Next Session

1. MCP Supabase tools access
2. Production database backup
3. Test environment for validation
4. Access to historical calculation data
5. Time for thorough testing (~2 hours)

---

## ‚úÖ Session Success

This session successfully:
- Established clear data governance (Supabase only)
- Created comprehensive documentation structure
- Identified and documented all gaps
- Prepared complete migration strategy
- Set clear priorities for next session

**Ready for Formula Engine Implementation!**
